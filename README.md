# Assembly Line Quality Control

## Overview
A computer vision system for quality control in industrial robotics. It inspects products on an assembly line to detect defects using real-time image analysis.

## Features
- Detects defects (e.g., scratches, misalignments) in manufactured parts.
- Integrates with robotic arms for automated inspection.
- Uses OpenCV for image processing and defect classification.
- Logs inspection results for traceability.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `YOLO`
- Camera hardware (e.g., USB or IP camera)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/assembly-line-quality-control.git
